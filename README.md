# Credit Card Default Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will default on a credit card payment using Machine Learning techniques.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression
- Google Colab

## Machine Learning Steps
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Scaling using StandardScaler
4. Train-Test Split
5. Logistic Regression Model
6. Model Evaluation using:
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report

## Result
The model predicts credit card default with good accuracy and helps in financial risk analysis.
## Model Evaluation

The Logistic Regression model was evaluated using:

- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

The model successfully predicts credit card default risk based on customer financial data.
## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Default dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
It contains customer demographic data, credit history, and payment records.
